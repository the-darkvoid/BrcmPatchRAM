### Installation

Install one of BrcmPatchRAM.kext or BrcmPatchRAM2.kext depending on OS X version, never both.

  * BrcmPatchRAM.kext: for 10.10 or earlier.

  * BrcmPatchRAM2.kext: for 10.11 or later.

Also, install one firmware kext BrcmFirmwareData.kext or BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext, depending on installation location, never both.

  * BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext: Install to /System/Library/Extensions.  This kext is much more memory efficient than BrcmFirmwareData.kext and is the preferred configuration.

  * BrcmFirmwareData.kext: Most appropriate for EFI/Clover/kexts.  BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext, while much more memory efficient, cannot be injected as can BrcmFirmwareData.kext

  * Advanced users: For custom firmware injectors, install the injector plus BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext.  This works from either /S/L/E or EFI/Clover/kexts.  Optionally, you may remove all the firmwares from BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext/Contents/Resources.  If you're using the injector from Clover/kexts, the IOProviderClass in the Info.plist for BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext must be changed from "disabled_IOResources" to "IOResources".  And still, you may find it unreliable... as that is the way Clover kext injection is (it does not simulate kext installation perfectly).  In testing, best result was obtained if you replace the IOKitPersonalities entry in BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext Info.plist with that of the injector kext (no need for the injector at that point).

Also, if you have a non-PatchRAM device (or you're not sure), install one of BrcmNonPatchRAM.kext or BrcmNonPatchRAM2.kext, depending on OS X version, never both.  Although these kexts do not install any firmware (these devices have firmware built-in), they still depend on BrcmPatchRAM/BrcmPatchRAM2.kext.

  * BrcmNonPatchRAM.kext: for 10.10 or earlier

  * BrcmNonPatchRAM2.kext: for 10.11 or later.


### BrcmPatchRAM

__Note if you have an Apple MacBook/iMac/Mac Pro etc, follow the [Mac instructions](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-BrcmPatchRAM/blob/master/README-Mac.md)__

Most Broadcom USB Bluetooth devices make use of a system called RAMUSB.

RAMUSB allows the firmware for the device to be updated on-the-fly, however any updates previously applied are lost when shutting down the machine.

The Broadcom Windows driver will upload firmware into the Broadcom Bluetooth device on every startup, however for OS X this functionality is not supported out of the box.

BrcmPatchRAM kext is an OS X driver which applies PatchRAM updates for Broadcom RAMUSB based devices.

It will apply the firmware update to your Broadcom Bluetooth device on every startup / wakeup, identical to the Windows drivers.

The firmware applied is extracted from the Windows drivers and the functionality should be equal to Windows.

Note that the original Apple Broadcom bluetooth devices are not RAMUSB devices, and thus do not have the same firmware mechanism.


### BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext

To be used for OS X 10.11 or newer.

This kext is a simple injector... it does not contain a firmware uploader.  Try this kext if you wish to see if your device will work without a firmware uploader.

Do not use any of the other kexts (BrcmPatchRAM, BrcmPatchRAM2, BrcmFirmwareRepo, or BrcmFirmwareData) with this kext.

This kext is not provided in the distribution ZIP.  You can build it if you wish to try it.  It was removed as it presense was causing confusion for those that don't read carefully and didn't install the preferred kexts correctly.  It is not currently being updated with new devices.  If yours is not present, edit the Info.plist as needed.

All of the firmwares from the Windows package are present in the kext and automatically associated with their vendor/device-ids.  They are expected to work, but have not been confirmed.  If you can confirm a working device not listed above, please notify via the "issues" database on github.


#### More Installation Details

BrcmPatchRAM.kext and BrcmPatchRAM2.kext can be installed either through Clover kext injection or placed in /System/Library/Extensions.
Install only one, not both, depending on system version.

BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext does not work with Clover kext injection, unless using a device specific firmware injector.
BrcmFirmwareData.kext can work with Clover kext injection.

You can also use a device specific firmware injector (in conjunction with BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext).  In this scenario, BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext does work from Clover kexts.

You will find device specfic injectors in the 'firmwares' directory of the git repository.  They are not included in the distribution ZIP.


#### Details

BrcmPatchRAM consists of 2 parts:

 * BrcmPatchRAM itself communicates with supported Broadcom Bluetooth USB devices (as configured in the Info.plist), and detects if they require a firmware update. 
 
  If a firmware update is required, the matching firmware data will be uploaded to the device and the device will be reset.
	
 * BrcmFirmwareStore (implemented by either BrcmFirmwareData.kext or BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext) is a shared resource which holds all the configured firmwares for different Broadcom Bluetooth USB devices.

   Some devices require device specific firmware, while others can use the newest version available in the Windows drivers without issue.

   New firmwares are added/configured on a regular basis to support devices, so be sure to follow release updates, or log an issue if you find your device is not supported.

	Firmwares can be stored using zlib compression in order to keep the configuration size manageable.
	
After the device firmware is uploaded, the device control is handed over to Apple's BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport.
This means that for all intents and purposes your device will be native on OS X and support all functionalities fully.

It is possible to use the Continuity Activation Patch in combination with BrcmPatchRAM through Clover or through dokterdok's script: https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool 

Clover users can patch using KextsToPatch in config.plist.

#### Troubleshooting

After installing BrcmPatchRAM, even though your Bluetooth icon may show up, it could be that the firmware has not been properly updated.

Verify the firmware is updated by going to System Information and check the Bluetooth firmware version number under the Bluetooth information panel.

If the version number is "4096", this means no firmware was updated for your device and it will not work properly.

Verify any errors in the system log by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
    cat /var/log/system.log | grep -i brcm[fp]
```	
Ensure you check only the latest boot messages, as the system.log might go back several days.

If the firmware upload failed with an error, try installing the debug version of BrcmPatchRAM in order to get more detailed information in the log.

In order to report an error log an issue on github with the following information:
  
 * Device product ID
 * Device vendor ID
 * BrcmPatchRAM version used
 * Dump of BrcmPatchRAM debug output from /var/log/system.log showing the firmware upload failure


#### Firmware Compatibility

Some USB devices are very firmware specific and trying to upload any other firmware for the same chipset into them will fail.

This usually displays in the system log as:
    
    BrcmPatchRAM: Version 0.5 starting.
	BrcmPatchRAM: USB [0a5c:21e8 5CF3706267E9 v274] "BCM20702A0" by "Broadcom Corp"
	BrcmPatchRAM: Retrieved firmware for firmware key "BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1612_v5708".
	BrcmPatchRAM: Decompressed firmware (29714 bytes --> 70016 bytes).
	BrcmPatchRAM: device request failed (0xe000404f).
	BrcmPatchRAM: Failed to reset the device (0xe00002d5).
	BrcmPatchRAM: Unable to get device status (0xe000404f).
	BrcmPatchRAM: Firmware upgrade completed successfully.

The errors in between mean the firmware was not uploaded successfully, and the device will most likely need a specific firmware configured.

For other devices the newest firmware available (even though not specified specifically in the Windows drivers) works fine.


#### New devices

In order to support a new device, the firmware for the device needs to be extracted from existing Windows drivers.

A copy of the (current) latest Broadcom USB bluetooth drivers can be found here:
http://drivers.softpedia.com/get/BLUETOOTH/Broadcom/ASUS-X99-DELUXE-Broadcom-Bluetooth-Driver-6515800-12009860.shtml#download

*Should you come across newer drivers than 12.0.0.9860, please let me know.*

In order to get the device specific firmware for your device take the following steps:

 * Look up your USB device vendor and product ID, in this example we will be using the BCM94352Z PCI NGFF WiFi/BT combo card, for which the vendor is 0930 and product ID 0233.
  
 * Extract the Windows Bluetooth driver package and open the bcbtums-win8x64-brcm.inf file.
  
 * Find your vendor / device ID combination in the .inf file
```dosini
%BRCM20702.DeviceDesc%=BlueRAMUSB0223, USB\VID_0930&PID_0223       ; 20702A1 Toshiba 4352
```
 * Locate the mentioned "RAMUSB0223" device in the .inf file:
```dosini
;;;;;;;;;;;;;RAMUSB0223;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
[RAMUSB0223.CopyList]
bcbtums.sys
btwampfl.sys
BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1457.hex
```	
		
 *  Copy the firmware hex file matching your device from the Windows package, in this case "BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1457.hex"
	
	
 *  The firmware file can now optionally be compressed using the included zlib.pl script:
```bash	
zlib.pl deflate BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1457.hex > BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1457.zhx
```	
 * After this a hex dump can be created for pasting into a plist editor:
```bash	
xxd -ps BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1457.zhx|tr '\n' ' ' > BCM20702A1_001.002.014.1443.1457.dmp
```		
 * Using a plist editor create a new firmware key under the *BcmFirmwareStore/Firmwares* dictionary.
 
  Note that the version number displayed in OS X is the last number in the file name (1457 in our sample) + 4096.

  So in this case the firmware version in OS X would be: "*c14 v5553*".
	
 * After configuring a key under *BcmFirmwareStore/Firmwares*, add your device ID as a new device for BrcmPatchRAM.

Firmwares can also be loaded directly from BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext/Contents/Resources, either by firmware key name (see above), or by naming the file with just the vendor and device-id.  For example, 0930_0223.hex (uncompressed) or 0930_0223.zhx (compressed).
 
 Copying an existing IOKit personality and modifying its properties is the easiest way to do this. 
 Configure the earlier firmware using its unique firmware key.
